# Zotero to NotebookLM Connector

A seamless bridge between Zotero and Google NotebookLM. This project consists of a Zotero 7 plugin and a Chrome extension that work together to sync your research library into NotebookLM in seconds.

## Features
- **Project-Based Sync**: Create custom sync rules (tags, collections, libraries) for different NotebookLM projects.
- **Smart Duplicate Detection**: Only uploads new or modified files. Tracks sync history per notebook.
- **Batch Upload**: Injects multiple files into NotebookLM simultaneously using a single click.
- **Modern UI**: Clean, icon-driven interface for managing your research streams.

## How to Sync
1. Open **Zotero** and ensure it's running.
2. Navigate to your target notebook in **Google NotebookLM**.
3. Click the **Zotero Connector** icon in your Chrome extension bar.
4. Click **"+"** to create a new project.
5. Enter your project details:
    - **Project Name**: Any name you'd like.
    - **Zotero Collection**: (Optional) The name of a Zotero collection (e.g., `Thesis`). If blank, searches your whole library.
    - **Sync Tag**: (Optional) A tag applied to items you want to sync (e.g., `#NotebookLM`).
    - **Library ID**: Use `0` for your personal library (default). Use the numeric ID from the URL for Group libraries.
6. Click **"Sync"** on your project card.
7. The extension will automatically open the "Add Source" dialog and inject your Zotero files.

## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Error**: Ensure Zotero is open and the NotebookLM tab is fully loaded.
- **No Files Found**: Double-check your Tag/Collection names. They are case-insensitive but must match the spelling.
- **Debugger Warning**: Chrome shows a bar saying "Debugger is attached". This is normal as the extension uses the Chrome DevTools Protocol to safely automate the file injection.
